A personal portfolio made using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

This is my personal portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a Junior Fullstack Developer. This portfolio is designed to have a minimalist UI. 

# Technologies Used

CSS3 - For styling and creating a responsive layout.
JavaScript - For interactive elements like the hamburger menu and animations.

# Features

- Hamburger Menu: A mobile-friendly navigation menu that toggles open and closed when clicked.
- Smooth Scrolling: Smooth transitions between sections when clicking navigation links.
